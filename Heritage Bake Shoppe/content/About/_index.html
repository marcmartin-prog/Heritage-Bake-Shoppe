        <p>Like most enterprises, Heritage Bake Shoppe began with dreams.  The dream to positively impact our community, the dream to provide job opportunities for our family and others, and the dream to create homestyle baked goods on demand. In September of 2020, those dreams came to fruition, and Heritage Bake Shoppe opened its doors, offering a lineup of deli meats and cheeses, sandwiches made to order, fresh baked goods, coffees, grill seasonings and some bulk food items.  Here, you can enjoy the nostalgic aroma of freshly baked bread, order a sandwich, custom made with fresh bread, sample high-quality meat and cheese (imported from Amish country), and treat yourself to exquisite danishes.</p>

        <p>Our family consists of me, Jason Miller, and my lovely wife Naomi.  God has given us 6 wonderful children, 4 girls and 2 boys.  Naomi has ample experience in creative culinary skills and enjoys exercising them at Heritage Bake Shoppe. Many of the recipes we use are ones she has personally perfected at home.  We are blessed with an excellent team of experts who consistently create high quality baked goods and sandwiches.  We are proud to serve each one of you, and we look forward to seeing you!</p>
